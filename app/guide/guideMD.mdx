# Hacky Holidays Guide

Hacky Holidays is a limited-time YSWS event for making your own PCB tree decorations! There are **3** major steps in making a successful decoration:

1. Choosing your Parts
2. Designing your PCB
3. Programming your PCB

### **This guide serves as a learning tool to help you get started. If you submit the guide PCB, you will not be accepted!**

## Choosing Your Parts

When choosing your parts, think about the function of each component, and try to eliminate unneeded components. Unneeded components can reduce your decoration’s battery life!

Parts covered in the guide:

- Neopixels (4 pin)
- Xiao ESP32C3
- Battery Holder
- Resistors/Diodes

If you want to add any components **not** on the approved list, ask one of the organizers in #hacky-holidays!

## Designing Your PCB

For this guide, we are going to be using KiCad. If you are using a different tool, your steps might be a bit different!

First, open up KiCad, and go to `File → New Project…` and name it whatever you want! Just make sure you name it something you remember so you can come back to it!

Then click on the **Schematic Editor** button. It will take you to a blank page where you will start designing your PCB!

## Programming Your PCB

To program your PCB, use the Arduino IDE and the Neopixels library! Here is a helpful resource to help you get started:

[Adafruit Neopixel Uberguide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-use)

To simulate your code, you can use [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/new/esp32-c3).

## Submissions & Manufacturing

Once you are ready to submit, create a PR in **OnBoard** with the Hacky-Holidays tag and submit your PR to this form!

PRs must include multiple things:

1. Schematic of your Board
2. Link to Wokwi with the board working

Once your PR gets approved and you are ready to order, we will order the PCB for you and ship it to your address!
